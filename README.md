<P>
  The provided code demonstrates how to build an interactive map using Leaflet.js. It initializes the map centered at specified coordinates and displays tiles from OpenStreetMap. A marker is added to the map with a popup, allowing users to interact. The map also features a circle and a polygon, each styled with colors and popups for user interaction. Additionally, the map responds to user clicks, displaying the clicked locationâ€™s latitude and longitude in a dynamic popup.

The code includes a responsive design for the map container, ensuring it occupies the full screen. Users can expand the functionality further by integrating external GeoJSON data, using custom icons for markers, or choosing from other tile providers like Mapbox. This example highlights the simplicity and flexibility of Leaflet.js for building interactive web-based maps.
